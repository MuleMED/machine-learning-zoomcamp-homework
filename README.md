## 📘 About the Course

The **Machine Learning Zoomcamp** is a practical course that teaches how to **build, train, and deploy ML models** effectively.  
It emphasizes the **engineering side** of machine learning — from data preparation and model training to deployment in production.

### I’m Learning:
- Core machine learning algorithms and when to use them  
- **Scikit-Learn** and **XGBoost**  
- Data preparation and feature engineering  
- Model evaluation, selection, and validation  
- Deploying models with **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, **Docker**, and **cloud platforms**  
- Using **Kubernetes** for ML model serving  
- Deep learning with **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
